# Student_Subject_Allocation
The "Student Allocation Management" project aims to efficiently allocate students to their preferred subjects based on their preferences and academic performance. The system employs a systematic approach, leveraging a combination of stored procedures and functions to optimize the allocation process.
At its core, the system maintains a table containing subjects along with the number of available seats in each subject. Students input their preferences, indicating their top choices. Simultaneously, their CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average) is recorded, providing an additional factor for allocation decisions.
The allocation process involves a stored procedure that sorts students by CGPA in descending order. This step ensures that students with higher academic performance are prioritized during allocation. For each student, the procedure starts by attempting to allocate their first preference. If seats are available, the student is assigned to that subject, and the available seat count is updated.
In cases where the first preference is unavailable, the system progresses to the student's subsequent preferences, attempting allocation until a suitable subject with available seats is found. If none of the preferences can be fulfilled, the student is marked as "unallocated," indicating their situation.
Finally, all allocated students are listed as "allocated," showcasing the successful assignments, while unallocated students are listed separately.
This project effectively streamlines the allocation process by considering both student preferences and academic performance. It ensures fairness and transparency, while efficiently utilizing available resources. By utilizing stored procedures, the project optimizes the allocation process, making it easier to manage and modify as needed. This innovative system demonstrates the application of technology to enhance the student allocation process and foster a smoother academic experience.
